This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(XML)

theURL <- "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population"
bowlPool <- readHTMLTable(theURL, which = 1, header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
bowlPool

```

```{r}
theURL <- "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population"
hvalues <- readHTMLTable(theURL)

hvalues

```

```{r}
library(XML)

theURL <- "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel"
bowlPool <- readHTMLTable(theURL, which = 1, header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
bowlPool

```

```{r}
